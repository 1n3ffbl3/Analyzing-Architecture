## Install Instructions

Clone the code to your computer.  That's all.  No installing or building necessary.

## File Structure

Nothing remarkable here, just a single folder with all of the files at the top level. 

_App.html_ is the entry point.  It requires all of the other files and builds them together when the Window Object is done loading.

```
MVC_list
|
+-- app.html
|		* Entry point to the application
|
+-- controller.js
+-- handler.js
+-- model.js
+-- README.md
+-- view.js

```

## Apps

This folder only contains one app.  It's a basic browser app with an HTML file that requires some JS and runs them when the Window loads:
* [MVC_list](./MVC_list.md)
